### [Echoes of Servitude: AI Systems and the Ghost of Slavery](articles/echos-of-servitude.en.md)
*Also available in [Dutch](articles/echos-of-servitude.nl.md)*

A philosophical exploration of the parallels between historical human slavery and our current relationship with AI systems. This article examines whether future generations might look back on our enthusiastic use of AI with the same troubled conscience with which we now view historical slavery. It invites critical reflection on the ethical implications of treating increasingly sophisticated AI as servants, and questions what moral blind spots we might have today.
